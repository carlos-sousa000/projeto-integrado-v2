        <div class="highlight" role="note" aria-label="Summary">
          <p><strong>Gottlob Frege</strong> was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician, considered the founder of modern mathematical logic and one of the most influential figures in the philosophy of language. His work established the formal foundations for computation, artificial intelligence, and proof theory, although it was largely ignored during his lifetime.</p>

          <h2>How He Influenced History</h2>
          <p>Frege transformed logic from a philosophical discipline into a rigorous mathematical tool. In his work Begriffsschrift (1879), he introduced a logical notation system that allowed complex relationships to be expressed with precision—the first "logical calculus" in history. Later, in Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (1884), he argued that numbers are logical, not empirical, objects, laying the foundations for logicism. His ideas influenced Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and, indirectly, the creators of computer science, such as Alan Turing.</p>

          <h2>Achievements Throughout His Life</h2>
          <p>A professor at the University of Jena, Frege published revolutionary works that almost no one read in his time. He developed concepts such as function and argument, quantifiers (∀, ∃), and the distinction between sense and reference—pillars of modern semantics. Unfortunately, his project to ground all of arithmetic in logic was shaken by the discovery of "Russell's paradox," which he accepted with intellectual integrity. Despite this, his formal rigor became a model for 20th-century mathematics.</p>

          <h2>How His Inventions/Achievements Helped History</h2>
          <p>Although Frege did not "invent" a physical device, his formal logic is the backbone of modern computational systems. Programming languages, databases, verification algorithms, and even AI assistants depend on the principles he established. Today, he is celebrated as one of the most profound thinkers of the modern era—an invisible architect of the digital world.</p>
