        <div class="highlight" role="note" aria-label="Summary">
          <p><strong>Joseph Henry</strong> (1797–1878) was an American physicist and inventor, known for his contributions to electromagnetism. He was a professor at Princeton University and the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Self-taught, he began his career as an artisan before dedicating himself to science. He was internationally respected for his experimental rigor. He advocated for science applied to the public good.</p>

          <h2>How He Influenced History</h2>
          <p>Henry was fundamental to the development of the telegraph and other electromagnetic devices. His discoveries influenced Samuel Morse and other 19th-century inventors. He promoted scientific research in the US as the basis for national progress. His work helped establish the US as a scientific power. He was one of the first to understand the practical potential of electricity.</p>

          <h2>Achievements Throughout His Life</h2>
          <p>He built one of the first electromagnetic relays, essential for long-distance communication. He created experimental electric motors and electromagnetic bells. He developed the principle of the practical electromagnet, capable of lifting heavy weights. He improved the telegraph before Morse but did not patent his ideas. He also made contributions to meteorology and acoustics.</p>

          <h2>How His Inventions/Achievements Helped History</h2>
          <p>His advances in electromagnetism made long-distance electrical communication possible. The relay allowed electrical signals to be amplified and transmitted over thousands of kilometers. It directly influenced the Communications Revolution of the 19th century. His scientific legacy helped found modern electrical engineering. He was honored with the unit of inductance, the henry (H), in his name.</p>
