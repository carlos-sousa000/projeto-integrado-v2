				<div class="highlight" role="note" aria-label="Summary">
					<p><strong>The Difference Engine</strong>, conceived by Charles Babbage in 1821, was a milestone in the history of mechanical computing. Its main purpose was to automate the calculation of mathematical tables, such as logarithms and trigonometric functions, which were previously computed by hand and subject to human error.</p>

				<div class="article-body">
					<p><span class="callout">Overview</span> The Engine could add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers with precision using gears and toothed wheels — a revolutionary concept for its time. The project represented a major technical advance because it allowed complex calculations to be performed continuously without direct human intervention.</p>

					<h2>How the machine worked</h2>
					<p>The Difference Engine operated on the principle of finite differences, which approximates mathematical functions through repeated additions. Each gear and wheel in the machine had a specific role to store numeric digits and perform automatic operations. Although Babbage could not fully build a working model during his lifetime due to mechanical complexity and cost, the design demonstrated concepts that later became fundamental to modern computers. The precision and automation introduced by the engine inspired 19th-century engineers and scientists.</p>

					<h2>Contributions to history</h2>
					<p>The Difference Engine was not only a mechanical invention but also a symbol of innovation and forward thinking. By proposing a machine capable of automatic calculation, Babbage paved the way for programmable machines, a concept that would be fully realized decades later. Today the Difference Engine is recognized both as a technical achievement and as a historic milestone that represents the shift from manual mathematics to automation, influencing generations of computer scientists and mechanical engineers.</p>

					<h2>Importance of the machine</h2>
					<p>Besides its technical aspects, Babbage's Difference Engine had a significant impact on how society began to see machines as capable of processing information. It showed that mechanical devices could be trusted to perform tasks previously done by humans. The project also raised questions about the feasibility of automation and the organization of intellectual work, anticipating debates that would become central in the Industrial Age and later the Information Age.</p>
